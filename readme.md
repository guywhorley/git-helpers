# git_helpers

## Description

The git_helpers repository contains batch files and/or shell scripts related to Github workflow.

In the spirit of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), theses scripts automate repetitive git tasks, hoping to gain back a few precious moments of time. Because, really, any time gained can be funneled back into the activities that really matter in the grand scheme of things: enjoying craft beer, walking my dog, exploring any open-world RPG...
