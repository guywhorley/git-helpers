# git_helpers

## Description

The git_helpers repository contains batch files and/or shell scripts related to Github workflow.

In the spirit of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), theses scripts automate repetive git tasks, hoping to gain back a few precious moments of time. Because, really, any time gained from this can be funnelled back into the things that really matter: enjoying craft beer, walking my dog, exploring any open-world RPG...
